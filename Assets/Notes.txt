Core gameplay loop:

You start off with some n hearts. When you run out of hearts you lose.

3 components:
- Keep: each round you get some random amount of letters. Keep allows you to store those letters for your next round. Maybe n letters kept depletes your life by n
- It: the word you start with, you draw from your kept / available letters to modify the word, only by adding to the start or end of the word
- Alive: if your word is valid, and isn't the same as a previous word you entered you gain a heart and progress to the next round

Also to add:
a time limit on each round
